 the estimated slope of the 200 largest  tallies starting at  1.91979E-01 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

       34   missed  1 of 10 tfc bin checks: the estimated mean has a trend during the last half of the problem                        
         passed all bin error check:     1 tally bins all have relative errors less than 0.10 with no zero bins


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       1 of the     1 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.
